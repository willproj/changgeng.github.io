#### **Personal projects**
  **C++ rendering engine**   

* Designed and implemented physical-based-rendering pipeline by **OpenGL** and **GLSL** to achieve **photorealistic effects**.
* Implemented model loading system by **Assimp** to allow users to load third-party models.
* Implemented keyboard mouse event system by **singleton pattern** as an independent module to make modules **low coupling**.
* Implemented user interface by **ImGui** to allow users to change the properties of renderers and create different rendering scenes.
* Built static libraries of UI module and rendering module to optimize execution speed at run time.
* Implemented **scene serialization by Yaml** to allow users to save different scenes to local directories or read local scene 
files.
* Constructed **Lua scripts** to maintain the configuration of project by using premake5. 
* Implemented soft shadow effect by **percentage-closer filtering algorithm**, cubemaps, gamma correction and HDR effect   

**Dungeons & Dragons Game Database Web**

* Designed and implemented frontend by using **HTML,CSS,JavaScript** and backend by using **python and Sqlite**.
* Deduplication of raw data and completion of missing data by implementing a simple search tool. 
* Provided different analysis methods by implementing SQL query operations.
* Implemented a **user-friendly interface** to allow users to analysis data by clicking without typing.
* Implemented example query questions and answers for students who start to learn database.
* Finished and improved the **document** which includes introduction, guidance and features with teammates

**Json interpreter**   

* Implemented **recursive descent parser**.
* Avoided extra unnecessary code and untested code by applying **test driven development**.
* Support **cross platforms**: windows,Linux,OS X. **Support different compilers**:VC,gcc,clang.
* Support UTF-8 Json context.
* Implemented a simple **unit test system** to maintain the project

**Covid19 Data Visualization Web**

* Collected most countries covid19 data by **Json** format, removed unnecessary data and unified data from different Json 
files.
* Designed and Implemented web interface by using **React.js**.
* Implemented **Pie chart, Bar chart and line chart** by using **Echarts** for the data of death, recovered, infected people and the data changes by every 2 weeks period. 
* Provided a clear comparison for the number of each group of people and the virus infection trends.
* Webpage is **Deployed on Github Pages**

**Sorting Algorithms Visualizer** 

* Designed and implemented web interface by using **React.js**.
* Implemented bubbleSort, SelectionSort, QuickSort, MergeSort, InsertionSort methods. 
* Help students to understand how sorting methods compared in velocity and how each sorting method sort lists.
* Webpage is **Deployed on Github Pages**
